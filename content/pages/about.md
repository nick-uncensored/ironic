  What is happening
section1: >-
  ## I'm nobody important


  I like the title for this site. It's so Ironic that I created my own business and have a career. I feel out of place sometimes, like I found a cheat code.
section2: >-
  ## Love what you do and never work a day...


  I heard this phrase when I was a kid. I never had any real hobbies (or what i would considered a hobby). After I finally took my future seriously, I just set goals and started seeing results.


  I had failures, too. Lots! Instead of dwelling, I learned to always find a lesson to learn, or treated the loss as part of the journey. Reading a bunch of books on "power" early on created a mind-set that made me take more risks.
